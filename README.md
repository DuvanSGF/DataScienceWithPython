# What is Data Science?

Data science is a multidisciplinary field that unifies statistics, data analysis,
machine learning and their related methods to extract knowledge and insights.

#Why Python?

In this Introduction to Data Science course we’re learning data science with Python.
As a general-purpose programming language, Python is now the most popular programming language in data science.
It’s easy to use, has great community support, and integrates well with other frameworks (e.g., web applications) in an engineering environment.

This course focuses on exploratory data analysis with three fundamental Python libraries: numpy, pandas and matplotlib.
The machine learning library scikit-learn will be covered as well.

In data science, there are other popular programming languages, such as R, which has an edge in statistical modeling
