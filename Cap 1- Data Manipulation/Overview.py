What is Data Science?

There are many use cases in business for data science including finding a better housing price prediction algorithm for Zillow,
finding key attributes associated with wine quality, and building a recommendation system to increase the click-through-rate for Amazon.

Extracting insights from seemingly random data, data science normally involves collecting data, cleaning data, performing exploratory data analysis,
building and evaluating machine learning models, and communicating insights to stakeholders.
